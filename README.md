# SGGW Schedule Mobile

*When there is no plan, you have to make one.*

## Description

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are ***not*** creating schedules that are available in the app. We are only creating the app itself, so do not blame us if current schedules are not like you want them to be or incorrect.

This project is a mobile application that allows you to view schedules for your classes. It is designed for students of Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW) but can be used by anyone. The application is written in Flutter and Dart. It uses a custom API with database made by Us. There is also a creator panel for plannists to create schedules in the database. The application is available on Android, iOS and Web.
